                <h2>Greggs Vegan Revolution</h2>
                <p>In January 2019, Greggs launched the Vegan Sausage Roll, creating a cultural phenomenon that transformed the UK's perception of vegan food. What started as a single product has evolved into a comprehensive vegan menu, proving that plant-based food can be mainstream, delicious, and affordable.</p>
                
                <p>Greggs' commitment to vegan options has made plant-based eating accessible to millions of Britons who might never have considered it otherwise. By offering vegan items at the same affordable prices as meat-based equivalents, Greggs has democratised vegan food in the UK.</p>

                <h2>The Vegan Sausage Roll Story</h2>
                <div class="info-grid">
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h3>Social Media Sensation</h3>
                        <p>The Vegan Sausage Roll was launched following a viral petition by PETA UK. When Greggs teased the launch on Twitter, it generated millions of impressions and became one of the most talked-about food launches in UK history.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h3>Award Winner</h3>
                        <p>The Vegan Sausage Roll won PETA's "Best Vegan Food Launch" award and has been credited with normalising vegan food in mainstream British culture. It proved that vegan alternatives could be just as tasty as traditional options.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h3>Sales Success</h3>
                        <p>In its first year, Greggs sold over 2 million Vegan Sausage Rolls, exceeding all expectations. The product's success led Greggs to expand their vegan range significantly, with new plant-based items added regularly.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Choose Greggs Vegan Options?</h2>
                
                <h3>Taste First</h3>
                <p>Greggs vegan items aren't marketed as "healthy alternatives" or "substitutes" – they're positioned as delicious food in their own right. The Vegan Sausage Roll tastes remarkably similar to the original, with a savoury, peppery filling wrapped in golden pastry.</p>

                <h3>Price Parity</h3>
                <p>Unlike many outlets that charge premium prices for vegan options, Greggs prices their vegan items competitively. The Vegan Sausage Roll costs just £1.35, only 10p more than the standard version, making plant-based eating accessible to all budgets.</p>

                <h3>Mainstream Accessibility</h3>
                <p>With over 2,000 Greggs locations across the UK, vegan food has never been more accessible. You can find a vegan option in almost every town and city, at train stations, service stations, and high streets nationwide.</p>

                <h3>Environmental Benefits</h3>
                <p>Choosing vegan options reduces your carbon footprint. Plant-based meals typically require fewer resources and produce less greenhouse gas emissions than meat-based equivalents, making them better for the planet.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>What Makes It Vegan?</h2>
                <p>The Vegan Sausage Roll filling is made from Quorn mycoprotein, which is derived from a type of fungus. Combined with vegetables, herbs, and spices, it creates a savoury, meat-like texture without any animal products. The pastry is made vegan-friendly by using vegetable oils instead of butter.</p>

                <p>All vegan items at Greggs are certified by The Vegan Society, ensuring they meet strict standards for plant-based food. However, items are prepared in the same kitchens as non-vegan products, so cross-contamination may occur.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
                <p>The Greggs Vegan Sausage Roll has transcended being "just food" to become a cultural phenomenon:</p>

                <h3>Media Coverage</h3>
                <p>The launch received unprecedented media attention, featuring on national news, in newspapers, and across social media. Celebrities and influencers posted reviews, with Piers Morgan's controversial criticism actually boosting sales.</p>

                <h3>Changing Attitudes</h3>
                <p>Before the Vegan Sausage Roll, plant-based food was often seen as niche or worthy. Greggs helped normalise vegan eating for mainstream Britain, showing that vegan food could be convenient, tasty, and affordable.</p>

                <h3>Industry Influence</h3>
                <p>The success prompted other chains to expand their vegan offerings. From McDonald's to KFC, major brands followed Greggs' lead in making plant-based options a core part of their menus rather than an afterthought.</p>

                <h3>Sales Impact</h3>
                <p>The vegan range is credited with helping Greggs achieve record sales and profits. The products attracted new customers who might not have previously visited Greggs, whilst existing customers enjoyed having more choice.</p>

                <h2>Vegan Menu FAQs</h2>

                <h3>Is the Vegan Sausage Roll suitable for meat-eaters?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Many meat-eaters love the Vegan Sausage Roll. It's not a "substitute" but a delicious product in its own right. The peppery, savoury filling appeals to vegans and non-vegans alike.</p>

                <h3>Are vegan items more expensive?</h3>
                <p>Not significantly. The Vegan Sausage Roll costs £1.35 compared to £1.35 for the standard version (prices may vary). Greggs maintains price parity to make vegan food accessible to everyone.</p>

                <h3>Are vegan items cooked separately?</h3>
                <p>Vegan items are prepared in the same kitchens and may share equipment with non-vegan products. Whilst care is taken, cross-contamination may occur. They're suitable for dietary vegans but may not meet the standards of strict vegans concerned about trace contact.</p>

                <h3>Why aren't there more vegan sandwiches?</h3>
                <p>Greggs has experimented with various vegan sandwiches and items. Availability varies by location and season. The current range reflects the most popular items that sell consistently across all shops.</p>

                <h3>Can I request vegan options if my local Greggs doesn't stock them?</h3>
                <p>Product availability is determined by demand and shop size. You can express interest to shop staff, though they may not be able to stock all items. Larger stores typically have wider vegan selections.</p>

                <h3>Are vegan items healthier?</h3>
                <p>Not necessarily. Vegan doesn't automatically mean healthy – the Vegan Sausage Roll contains 271 calories and is still a treat food. However, it does contain less saturated fat than the meat version and offers environmental benefits.</p>

                <h3>Will Greggs add more vegan options?</h3>
                <p>Greggs continues to trial new vegan items based on customer demand and sales performance. They've shown commitment to expanding plant-based options, so expect more vegan products in future.</p>
