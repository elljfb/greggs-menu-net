                <h2>The Power of a Logo</h2>
                <p>The impact of a logo cannot be overstated when it comes to shaping the perception of a company, brand, or franchise. A well-designed logo instantly communicates the essence of the business it represents, influencing how customers perceive and remember the brand. A strong logo attracts people to the brand, leaving a lasting positive impression and fostering brand loyalty.</p>
                
                <p>Conversely, a poorly crafted logo can detract from the brand's image, resulting in diminished recognition and a less favourable perception amongst consumers. In essence, a logo serves as a powerful tool for brand identity and can significantly impact the success and longevity of a business.</p>

                <p>Greggs' logo has undergone a few different changes during the company's history, finally settling on the iconic blue, orange and white logo we have today.</p>

                <h2>Logo Evolution Timeline</h2>

                <div class="info-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>1950s – 1970s: The Original</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: center; padding: 2rem; background: #f5f5f5; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
                        <img src="../images/Jr_gregg.webp" alt="Greggs Logo 1950s-1970s" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    </div>
                    <p>When the bakery was originally founded it had a standard name written on the front of the building which read 'J. R. Gregg' like many other shops, bakeries and butchers of the time. This simple signage reflected the modest beginnings of what would become one of Britain's most beloved brands.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>1970s – 1986: The Groovy Era</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: center; padding: 2rem; background: #f5f5f5; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
                        <img src="../images/Greggsold.webp" alt="Greggs Logo 1970s-1986" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    </div>
                    <p>In the 1970s the logo underwent a change and met with the groovy company logos of the time with a stylish typeface. This reflected the design trends of the era, with flowing letters and a more contemporary feel that aligned with the decade's aesthetic preferences.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>1986 – 2001: The Foundation of Modern Greggs</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: center; padding: 2rem; background: #f5f5f5; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
                        <img src="../images/Greggs_logo_1986.webp" alt="Greggs Logo 1986-2001" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    </div>
                    <p>Then in 1986 the company changed their logo again which is similar to the logo we see today. It featured 4 small squares on the left and a more traditional font with the word 'Greggs'. This design marked a significant shift towards corporate branding and established visual elements that would carry forward into future iterations.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="info-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>2001 – 2014: Introducing the Colour Palette</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: center; padding: 2rem; background: #f5f5f5; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
                        <img src="../images/Greggs.png" alt="Greggs Logo 2001-2014" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    </div>
                    <p>In the early 2000s Greggs' logo changed again and introduced the blue, orange and white we see today but with a more modern font for the time. The colour combination – blue representing trust and reliability, orange conveying warmth and energy, and white ensuring clarity – created a memorable brand identity that stood out on British high streets.</p>
                    <p>They also had a variant of the logo with the words 'The Bakers' included, emphasising the company's heritage and commitment to fresh baking.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>2014 – Present: The Digital Age</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: center; padding: 2rem; background: #f5f5f5; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
                        <img src="../images/Greggs_2014.png" alt="Greggs Logo 2014-Present" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    </div>
                    <p>Then in 2014, to fit in with the flat digital style of branding, they changed their logo again with a more modern font and some gradient in the colours. This refresh ensured the logo worked effectively across digital platforms, mobile apps, and social media whilst maintaining the brand's recognisable identity.</p>
                    <p>There are also variants that are one colour and also include various slogans, allowing for flexibility across different marketing materials and applications. The current logo represents a perfect balance between tradition and modernity, honouring Greggs' heritage whilst embracing contemporary design principles.</p>

                        <h3>Colour Psychology</h3>

                        <h3>Typography</h3>
                        <p>The evolution of Greggs' typography reflects changing design trends, moving from ornate 1970s lettering to clean, modern sans-serif fonts that work across all media. The current font is bold, legible and friendly, reflecting the brand's approachable nature.</p>

                <h2>Impact on Brand Recognition</h2>
                <p>The current Greggs logo is one of the most recognisable in British retail. A study found that 96% of UK adults recognise the Greggs brand, putting it amongst the most well-known brands in the country. This recognition is partly down to the effective logo design that has evolved thoughtfully over the decades.</p>

                <p>The logo's simplicity makes it versatile – it works equally well on shop fronts, packaging, digital platforms, and promotional materials. The bold lettering ensures visibility from a distance, crucial for high street locations, whilst the friendly, rounded letters create an approachable feel that aligns with Greggs' positioning as an affordable, everyday bakery for everyone.</p>

                <h3>Digital Adaptation</h3>
                <p>The 2014 refresh was particularly important for digital adaptation. The simplified design scales well across different screen sizes, from desktop websites to mobile apps. The flat design aesthetic fits modern user interface trends, ensuring the brand feels contemporary and relevant to younger consumers whilst remaining familiar to long-time customers.</p>
